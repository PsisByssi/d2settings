When you first open d2settings you will be prompted to naviage to the steamapps folder. You will also have the option to save directly into the dota2/cfg folder. To do this you will have to administrative rights. The alternative is to save into another folder and move the files manually.

To edit these settings go gear icon in the bottom right.
The green refresh looking arrow will reload your settings.
The 3/4 floppy disk will save your config.

In the d2settings save folder you will find all the scripts as well as a shortcut loader called d2settings. Create a shortcut to this file and it will launch the scripts and dota at the same time for you.
