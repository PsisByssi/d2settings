A graphical interface to your dota 2 config file.
Dota2 is a game built on Valves source engine. If you are familiar with steam you will know some games that have a console. The console allows you to set keymappings and settings that are often not found anywhere else. To automate this you can  throw your settings into a file that will be loaded when you start Dota2. This file is commonly refered to as the autoexec file in dota2.

D2settings gives you a graphical interface to make changing settings easier for everybody. Currently it only runs on windows but it woudln't take alot of effort to be linux ready.
