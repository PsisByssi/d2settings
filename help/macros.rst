Smart Attack/Hold/Stop-
Note:
Having auto attack on has side effects and no benifets.  
Your hero will attack the closest thing near to him if no order is given or if he is attacked.
Whenever you have not gotten a command your hero should be doing nothing.
Otherwise he will automatically attack enemeies/wards that are in sentry range, reveal your position in trees etc.

Auto attack on proviedes no beneifit when juking as your hero will have to complete the move first before attacking.
It is true by pressing stop or hold your hero will stop, and then autoattack the closest thing possible. This may not always
be the guy who is juking. Its bad habit. You should a click the hero or the ground. This will give you the desired effect
of moving to that position and attacking as soon as possible.

With auto attack off you have no distinction between hold and stop, so smart hold will make your hero hold
his position with auto attack on, this is useful for lazy people who like using it to cancel attacks or to attack stacks while pulling and attacking stacks
. Also if you cannot pause the game or something u can press h to make him stay but attack anything that comes his way

use of smart attack or stop will turn auto attack back off.
